# AirTrafficControl_Concurrent

**AirTrafficControl** is a multi-threaded Java application designed to simulate air traffic control operations. It efficiently manages and coordinates aircraft landings and takeoffs while addressing synchronization challenges such as deadlock prevention and starvation avoidance.

## Features

- **Multi-threading:** Simulates concurrent aircraft operations.
- **Synchronization:** Uses mutexes and semaphores for safe runway access.
- **Deadlock Prevention & Starvation Avoidance:** Ensures smooth operation without indefinite waiting.
- **Realistic Simulation:** Models real-world air traffic control scenarios for optimal runway utilization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or later
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor
- Maven or Gradle (optional, if you use dependency management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkyTraffic-Manager.git
   cd SkyTraffic-Manager
Compile the project:

If using Maven:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn compile
Or compile manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac -d bin src/*.java
Running the Simulation
Run the main class to start the simulation:

bash
Copy
Edit
java -cp bin com.yourpackage.Main
The simulation will launch, displaying aircraft operations and runway statuses on the console.

Code Structure
Main.java: The entry point of the simulation.
RunwayManager.java: Manages runway access using synchronization techniques.
Aircraft.java: Represents individual aircraft as threads.
Controller.java: Coordinates overall air traffic operations.
